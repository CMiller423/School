if you get a bunch of link errors when running the program change line 3 in the main program (cm_Assignment_3) to say
#include "Rational-WithCode.h"

all that file is the the Rational.h and Rational.cpp together, I dont know why I cant get my compiler to run the .h and .cpp
files seperatly, for some reason they just wont link together which is why i wrote this contegency because i know it will work
if they are put together. Still not sure why it does that.
